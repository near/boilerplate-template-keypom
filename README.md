## About

This project is created for easy-to-start as a React + IPFS skeleton template in the Pagoda Gallery. It was initialized with [create-near-app]. Clone it and start to build your own gallery project!

### Built With

[create-near-app], [amazing-github-template](https://github.com/dec0dOS/amazing-github-template)

Getting Started
==================

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed ‚Äì we are targeting versions `16+`.

Read about other [prerequisites](https://docs.near.org/develop/prerequisites) in our docs.

Optionally create an account on [web3.storage](https://web3.storage) in order to upload files directly to IPFS from the frontend.

Generate an API token on web3.storage by following [this guide](https://web3.storage/docs/how-tos/generate-api-token/) and, finally, store the token in your `frontend/.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3_STORAGE_AUTH_TOKEN`. Note this means the API token will be available to anyone who has access to your website. This might not be ideal for a production application but works great for prototyping.

### Installation

Install all dependencies:

    npm install

Deploy your NFT contracts to TestNet with a temporary dev account:

    npm run deploy

Initialize the NFT contract (customize this to your needs):

    near call <neardev-account> new '{"owner_id":"<YOUR_ACCOUNT>","metadata": {"spec":"nft-1.0.99","name":"<YOUR_NFT_NAME>","symbol":"<YOUR_UNIQUE_SYMBOL>","base_uri":"https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/"}}' --accountId <YOUR_ACCOUNT>

You also need to add keypom as an approved minter to mint NFTs on your behalf, add approved minters to NFT series contract:
    
    near call <neardev-account> add_approved_minter '{"account_id":"beta.keypom.testnet"}' --accountId <YOUR_ACCOUNT>

By default, only the owner will be able to create NFT series on this contract. You can optionally add anyone else as an approved creator by running:

    near call <neardev-account> add_approved_creator '{"account_id":"<APPROVED_ACCOUNT>"}' --accountId <YOUR_ACCOUNT>

Usage
=====

Start your frontend in development mode:

    npm run dev

Start your frontend in production mode:

    npm run start

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The pre-built smart-contract code lives in the `/contracts` folder. This app is built from [Keypom's NFT tutorial series app](https://github.com/keypom/nft-tutorial-series). In blockchain apps the smart contract is the "backend" of your app.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder. `/frontend/pages/index.tsx` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it uses `/frontend/contracts/keypom-contract.ts`,
   this is your entrypoint to learn how the frontend connects to the NEAR blockchain.


Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts].
When you run `npm run deploy`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a temporary dev account.
When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how:


Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `npm install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    npm install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `near-blank-project.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet

Step 2: deploy the contract
---------------------------

Use the CLI to deploy the contract to TestNet with your account ID.

    near deploy --accountId near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet --wasmFile ./contracts/nft-series/nft-series.wasm


Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.
